ACADEMIC PROJECT EXPERIENCE

COVID-19 Detection Using Cough Sound
-Developed a COVID-19 detection tool using log-mel spectrogram features from cough audio signals, leveraging customized deep learning algorithms for accurate and automated classification.
-Enabled a non-invasive, cost-effective, and scalable solution for early COVID-19 diagnosis, offering a potential alternative for mass screening during pandemics. Achieved high classification accuracy i.e., >90% in testing datasets, reducing diagnostic time significantly compared to traditional methods and demonstrating real-world feasibility for deployment in healthcare systems.

Vehicle Tracking and Speed Estimation From Traffic Videos
-Developed a real-time vehicle tracking and speed estimation system leveraging OpenCV, Haar cascades, and NumPy for vehicle detection and tracking. Utilized Python for algorithm development and integrated video processing frameworks to analyze traffic videos efficiently. Provided a scalable solution to enhance urban traffic management and road safety, enabling efficient vehicle monitoring and proactive identification of traffic violations.
-Enabled actionable insights for traffic authorities, such as identifying speeding vehicles in real-time and optimizing traffic flow patterns, contributing to a potential 20% reduction in traffic congestion and enhanced road safety outcomes.
